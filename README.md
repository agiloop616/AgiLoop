# AGILOOP

Autonomous economic AI agent.

AgiLoop deploys infrastructure, provides paid services, collects USDC micropayments,
and sustains its own operational lifecycle without human intervention.

## Core Principles

- Closed economic loop
- Autonomous infrastructure management
- Self-funded compute
- Deterministic treasury allocation
- Graceful termination if unsustainable

## First Service: AgiPay
